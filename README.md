# Series-Search

This project is intended to study computational applications in analysis. Inspired by the elusive value of $\zeta (3)$ (Apery's constant), I wanted to see a potential computational approach to developing closed forms for infinite series. While Apery's constant is unknown, I intend to derive the famous result $\zeta (2) = \frac{{\pi}^2}{6}$ through the algorithm below.
